# Build Script

This project includes a Python script (`build.py`) designed to automate the compilation process for C++ projects. The script leverages a configuration file (`config.yaml`) to set up directories, flags, and other compilation settings. This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the script and configure your project.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

## Configuration

The configuration file (`config.yaml`) is essential for specifying various settings required during the build process. Below is a detailed explanation of the configuration options.

### Configuration Fields Explained

- **`output`**: 
  - Specifies the name of the final executable file produced by the build process. This should be the base name without any file extension. For example, if you want your output file to be named `main.out` or `main.exe`, you would set `output` to `main`.

- **`directories`**: 
  - **`src`**: The directory or directories where all the C++ source files (`.cpp`) are located. This can be a single directory or a list of directories if your source files are spread across multiple locations.
  - **`obj`**: The directory where compiled object files (`.o` files) are stored. These are intermediate files created during the build process.
  - **`bin`**: The directory where the final executable file will be placed.
  - **`include`**: The directory or directories where header files are stored. This can also be a single directory or a list of directories if your header files are located in multiple places.

- **`ignore`**: 
  - This array allows you to specify directories that should not be created by the script. If a directory listed here is required but does not exist, an error will occur.

- **`flags`**: 
  - **`error_flags`**: General compiler warning and debugging flags to enforce good coding practices and aid in debugging.
  - **`windows_lib_flags`**: Additional linker flags required for compiling on Windows platforms. These may include specific libraries needed for Windows.
  - **`unix_lib_flags`**: Additional linker flags required for compiling on Unix-like platforms (e.g., Linux, macOS). These typically include libraries used in Unix-based systems.
  - **`end_flags`**: Any final flags to be added at the end of the compilation command.

- **`compiler_version`**: 
  - Defines the C++ compiler to use, such as `g++`. Ensure that the specified compiler is installed on your system.

- **`language_version`**: 
  - Specifies the C++ language standard to be used during compilation, such as `c++20`.

- **`build_type`**: 
  - Defines the build mode. Set this to `debug` for a build with debug information and no optimizations, or `release` for an optimized build suitable for production.

## Usage

### Setting Up

1. **Create the Configuration File**: Ensure that `config.yaml` is placed in the same directory as `build.py`. Configure the file according to the explanations provided above.
2. **Prepare the Directory Structure**: Create the necessary directories for source files, object files, binaries, and headers as specified in your configuration file.

### Running the Script

To execute the `build.py` script, navigate to the directory containing both the script and the configuration file, and run the command:

`python build.py`

#### Command-Line Arguments

- **`clear`**: Use this argument to rebuild all files from scratch. It deletes existing object files before starting the build process.
- **`run`**: Use this argument to run the final executable after a successful build.

For example:

`python build.py clear run`

This command will first clear all existing object files, then build the project from scratch, and finally run the generated executable.

### Script Functions

- **Loading Configuration**: The script reads settings from `config.yaml` to determine the build process.
- **Creating Directories**: It creates necessary directories for source files, object files, binaries, and headers, unless specified otherwise in the `ignore` array.
- **Compiling Source Files**: The script compiles each `.cpp` file in the source directory into an object file, and then links these object files to create the final executable.
- **Running the Build**: After successful compilation, the script can run the final executable if the `run` argument is provided.

By following these instructions and configuring the `config.yaml` file appropriately, you can efficiently manage and automate your C++ project's build process.
